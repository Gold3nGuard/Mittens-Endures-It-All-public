Not only is he reluctant to let her go pee, but when she is finally allowed to pee, she immediately feels an even stronger urge to go again when she returns.  Still, they work their way up to a sweaty climax - her acting is excellent, or maybe not even acting - the bulge of her bladder is clearly visible on screen." ,
