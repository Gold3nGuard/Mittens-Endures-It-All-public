## About
"Mittens Endures It All" is a visual novel dating sim written in Ren'Py. It's basically a Lumity retelling of the classic omorashi game "Melissa Explains It All".

## Inspiration

- The primary source of inspiration for this game is ["Melissa Remake" by WielkiJa](https://www.omorashi.org/files/file/14514-melissa-remake-beta/)
- A lot of my code is a direct translation from [Pisikak's "Melissa Endures It All" source code](https://www.omorashi.org/files/file/9194-melissa-endures-it-all/)
- And the original game that inspired all of us is ["Melissa Explains It All" by drw](https://onlinemel.angelfire.com/)
